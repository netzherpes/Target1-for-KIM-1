This little game uses the horizantal lines of the KIM-display as moving targets. Starting on the top row, a line moves from left to right. Button '3' is the Firebutton. Shoot to digit 4 on the display. If you hit, the target stripe moves one level up or is gone (you win), if you miss its moving towards you. You can miss maximal 3 stripes until you lose.
